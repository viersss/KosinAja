## About The Project

Finding a suitable place to live is a common challenge for students. KosinAja aims to solve this by creating a centralized, user-friendly, and secure platform connecting students with property owners around the STIS campus. The project focuses on providing a seamless experience for both user roles: the student searching for a room and the owner listing a property.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- A local web server environment like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or MAMP.
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional, for cloning).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git)
    ```
    Alternatively, you can download the project as a ZIP file and extract it.

2.  **Move to Web Server Directory**
    - Place the project folder inside the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation.

3.  **Database Setup**
    - Start the Apache and MySQL modules from the XAMPP Control Panel.
    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
    - Create a new database named `kosinaja`.
    - Select the `kosinaja` database and go to the **Import** tab.
    - Upload the `.sql` file that contains the table structure and initial data. *(Note: You will need to export your current database to a `.sql` file first)*.

4.  **Configure Connection**
    - Open the `php/connect.php` file.
    - Adjust the database credentials if they differ from the default XAMPP setup.
    ```php
    <?php
    $host = 'localhost';
    $db_name = 'kosinaja';
    $username = 'root'; 
    $password = ''; // Change this if your MySQL root user has a password
    
    // ... rest of the code
    ?>
    ```

5.  **Run the Project**
    - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/your-project-folder-name` (e.g., `http://localhost/KosinAja`).
